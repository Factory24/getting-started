### Afrolynk's Factory24 Overview

With the increasing applications of technology in our daily lives, there has been a corresponding demand 
for skilled software engineers in Africa revolving areas involving mobile development and data science. 
With their existing knowledge, Afrolynk guides the entrepreneurs to take that step further and bridge this 
gap with the help of Factory24.

Factory24 is a stimulus to young entrepreneurs in Africa through bootcamps & training by offering mentoring 
sessions and workshops but also create a platform for these entrepreneurs to be exposed in an environment to 
meet potential employers.

we're currently developing to build next Gen Tech Entrepreneurs in 8 African countries including Tunisia, Ghana,
Kenya, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Uganda etc.
